\section{Cluster Weighting}
An alternative approach to correct for energy losses is the so-called \emph{local hadronic cell weighting} (LCW), which applies energy corrections already at cluster level.
This approach is used for different jet definitions, one of which is described in \cref{app:noise-term-rscan}
Different variables can be defined to characterize a topo-cluster based on its shape and other properties. These observables, known as \emph{cluster moments}, are used to extract information about the hadronic signal content in a given cluster which in turn is used to correct the energy to the \emph{LCW scale}. More information can be found in \ccite{PERF-2014-07}.
