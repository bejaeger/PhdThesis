\subsection{Preselection and common selections}
\label{subsec:preselection}
The transverse momenta of the two leptons must satisfy \ptGT{22}\,GeV and \ptGT{15}\,GeV for the higher-\pT (\emph{leading}) and lower-\pT (\emph{subleading}) lepton, respectively.
To minimise the contamination from both low-mass meson resonances as well as di-tau backgrounds from low-mass Dell-Yan production, the invariant mass of the dilepton system is required to be $\mll > 10\,\GeV$.
The distribution of the number of jets in the event at this preselection stage is shown in \cref{fig:njet-dist}.

  \label{fig:njet-dist}
\end{figure}
The signal and background composition varies significantly across jet bins, which motivates the split into separate \Njet signal categories.
% In total four mutually exclusive regions are defined.
% One region targets the VBF production mode and must satisfy \TwoJet.
% Three categories are defined targeting the ggF production mode: \ZeroJet, \OneJet, and \TwoJet.
To exploit the presence of neutrinos in the signal, a minimum threshold criterion of $\pTmiss > 20\,\GeV$\footnote{For a definition of the \pTmiss variable see \cref{chap:objects}.} is applied to all the ggF categories.
The background from top-quark processes is reduced in all analysis categories by vetoing events that contain a reconstructed $b$-jet with \ptGT{20}\,GeV.
Furthermore, a selection of $\mtt\,{<}\,m_Z - 25~\GeV$ is applied in the ggF \OneJet, \TwoJet, and VBF \TwoJet categories, to separate the signal categories from the majority of \Zgamma events.

% \Cref{subsec:vbf-category,subsec:ggf-zero-jet-category,subsec:ggf-one-jet-category,subsec:ggf-two-jet-category} provide details on the remaining selections used to define the four analysis SRs that are used to measure the ggF and VBF production cross section.

\subsection{ggF \ZeroJet category}
\label{subsec:ggf-zero-jet-category}
The distinct signal topology arising from the angular momentum correlations explained in \cref{sec:signal-bkg-characteristics} can be exploited well in events with no additional jet.
The opening angle between the missing transverse energy and the dilepton system is required to be $\DPhillMET \,{>}\, 1.57 \approx \frac{\pi}{2}$ and the transverse momentum of the dilepton system is required to have $\Ptll \,{>}\, 30\,\GeV$.
This drastically reduces the amount of background events from $Z/\gamma^*$ processes, while retaining a large fraction of signal events.
In addition, the non-resonant $WW$ production process can be separated from the signal with a requirement of $\mll < 55$\,\GeV\ and the remaining $Z/\gamma^*$ background can be further reduced by requiring $\DPhill < 1.8$.
In the statistical analysis, the \ZeroJet SR is further split into four mutually exclusive subregions defined by requiring $\mll \le 30$\,GeV and $\mll > 30$\,GeV, as well as $\pTsublead \le 20$\,GeV and $\pTsublead > 20$\,GeV, where \pTsublead is the \pT of the subleading lepton.
% This $b$-jet veto (or short $b$-veto) in the \ZeroJet\ analysis exploits the energy range below the nominal jet \pT\ threshold of $30\,\GeV$ and reaches down to $\pT = 20\,\GeV$.
% \todo{Reference to the possibility to use track jets?}

\subsection{ggF \OneJet category}
\label{subsec:ggf-one-jet-category}
The additional jet in the \OneJet category provides improved rejection against \Ztautau\ processes.
Further reduction of the \Zgamma background as well as multijet events is achieved with the maximum lepton transverse mass, max($m_{\text{T}}^\ell$), defined as the maximum value of 
\begin{equation}
    m_{\text{T}}^{\ell_i} = \sqrt{ 2 p_\text{T}^{\ell_i} \MET \cdot \left( 1 - \text{cos} \Delta \phi \left( \ell_i, \MET \right) \right) }.
\end{equation}
The max($m_{\text{T}}^\ell$) observable is expected to be smaller for \Zgamma and multijet production than for the signal process which motivates a requirement of max($m_{\text{T}}^\ell$)$ > 50\,$GeV.
Another selection is made on the invariant mass of the hypothetical $\tau\tau$ system, $m_{\tau\tau}$.
The $m_{\tau\tau}$ observable is constructed based on the so-called collinear approximation~\cite{Plehn:1999xi} that uses the direction and magnitude of the measured missing transverse momentum and projects it along the directions defined by the two reconstructed charged leptons~\cite{HWWPaper}.
A requirement of $m_{\tau\tau} < m_Z - 25\,\GeV$\footnote{The mass of the $Z$ boson, $m_Z$, is set to the value found in current experimental measurements, 91.1876\,GeV~\cite{PDG2020}.} is applied, which further reduces the contamination of \Zgamma processes that tend to have values close to $m_{\tau\tau} = m_Z$.
The same \mll\ and \DPhill\ selections as in the \ZeroJet category are applied in the \OneJet category.
As well, the same split into four subregions that is performed in the \ZeroJet category is done in the \OneJet category to define the final measurement regions. 

\subsection{VBF-enriched \TwoJet category}
\label{subsec:vbf-category}
The VBF signal discrimination in the VBF \TwoJet category is achieved with a DNN as explained in \cref{sec:dnn}.
Event selection criteria are nonetheless applied to ensure orthogonality with the ggF \TwoJet category and guarantee an adequate background estimation (see \cref{sec:bkg-estimation}).
Two criteria exploit the distinct VBF topology by rejecting events that either contain an additional jet with \ptGT{30}\,GeV between the two leading jets in pseudorapity (known as \emph{central jet veto} (CJV)) or a lepton at larger pseudorapidities than both of the jets (known as \emph{outside lepton veto} (OLV)).
In addition, a selection is made on the invariant mass of the jets $\mjj > 120\,\GeV$, which mainly serves to separate other physics analyses targeting the $V(\to qq)H$ Higgs production mode.
%The background contamination in this region is large. 
% The VBF signal process is then distinguished from the background processes by using a deep neural network model (DNN) that is trained to classify VBF signal and other non-VBF signal events.
% The output of the DNN is used as a final discriminant because it reflects the compatibility of an event having VBF signal-like kinematics. Details about the development of the VBF DNN analysis are provided in \cref{sec:dnn}.

\subsection{ggF-enriched \TwoJet category}
\label{subsec:ggf-two-jet-category}
The \TwoJet category targeting the ggF process is made mutually exclusive to the VBF-enriched \TwoJet category by requiring events to fail either the CJV or OLV. 
In addition, events from $V(\to qq) H$ production are highly suppressed by a requirement $|\mjj  - 85| \le 15\,\GeV$ and $\Delta y_{jj} \le 1.2$. 
The same \mll\ and \DPhill\ selections as in the \ZeroJet category are also applied in the ggF-enriched \TwoJet category, and two subregions are defined with a boundary at $\mll = 30\,\GeV$ for the statistical analysis. 

\subsection{STXS categorization}
\label{subsec:STXS-categorization}
% From Paper
%Cross section measurements are also conducted in the Stage-1.2 STXS category scheme, which refines 72 over the 1.1 scheme [14] the granularity of bins for ggF events with a Higgs boson produced with a large 73 transverse momentum. Selected events are categorized with requirements on the transverse momentum 74 of the reconstructed Higgs boson candidate (푝퐻 T ) and on the potential additional hadronic jets. The 75 ggF STXS template process (referred to subsequently as 푔푔퐻) is defined based on the Born 푔푔 → 퐻 76 process plus higher-order QCD and EW corrections. This includes real EW radiation, in particular the 77 푔푔 → 푍(→ 푞  ̄ 푞)퐻 process. The VBF STXS template process (referred to subsequently as EW 푞푞퐻) 78 is defined to include the 푉 (→ 푞  ̄ 푞)퐻 topology in addition to the usual VBF topology. After merging 79 certain STXS bins to ensure sensitivity for all the measured POIs, a total of 11 fiducial cross sections 80 corresponding to different STXS-bound kinematic regions are measured: 6 for 푔푔퐻 production and 5 for 81 EW 푞푞퐻 production.

The signal definitions in the STXS measurement is slightly altered with respect to the inclusive cross-section measurements.  
The ggF STXS template process (referred to subsequently as $ggH$) is defined based on the Born $gg \to H$ process plus higher-order QCD and EW corrections. This includes real EW radiation, in particular the $gg \to Z(\to q\bar{q})H$ process. The VBF STXS template process (referred to subsequently as EW $qqH$) is defined to include the $V(\to qq)H$ topology in addition to the usual VBF topology.~\cite{HWWPaper}

The Stage-1.2 STXS framework builds the basis for the event categorization of the STXS measurement. 
Some of the original Stage-1.2 STXS bins are merged to ensure a reasonable sensitivity for all cross-sections measured, and the reconstructed measurement regions (or SRs) are aligned to the merged STXS bins to guarantee optimal measurements. 
The merged STXS bins, referred to as Reduced Stage-1.2, and the reconstructed measurement regions are shown in \cref{fig:STXS_Diagram}. 
The original Stage-1.2 STXS definitions are provided in \cref{app:stxs-measurements-aux}. 
The signal processes are split into different \Njets categories, $\pTH$ bins, as well as \mjj bins. 
After the merging, a total of 11 fiducial cross sections are measured: 6 for $ggH$ production and 5 for EW $qqH$ production.
% -> ggF is written as ggH
% -> VBF is denoted as EW qqH that is more inclusive than VBF as it also includes V(->qq)H.

Specifically, a single STXS cross section with \ZeroJet is measured, targeted by a SR defined as the ggF \ZeroJet SR (see \cref{subsec:ggf-zero-jet-category}) but also adding a $\pTH < 200~\GeV$ selection.
Three STXS cross sections are measured for the \OneJet $ggH$ category, targeted by the SRs of the ggF \OneJet category (\cref{subsec:ggf-one-jet-category}) divided in different \pTH bins.
One cross section is measured for the \TwoJet $ggH$ category, targeted by the ggF \TwoJet SR defined in \cref{subsec:ggf-zero-jet-category} with an added $\pTH < 200~\GeV$ selection.
One $ggH$ STXS cross section is measured inclusive of \Njets, which is targeted by the ggF \TwoJet and \OneJet SRs each time with an added $\pTH \geq 200~\GeV$ selection.
Five STXS cross sections are measured for the \TwoJet EW $qqH$ category. One for $\pTH \ge200~\GeV$, targeted by the VBF \TwoJet SR (\cref{subsec:vbf-category}) with an added $\pTH \geq 200~\GeV$ selection, and four bins with $\pTH < 200~\GeV$ separated by \mjj, targeted by the VBF \TwoJet SR split in the same way in different \mjj bins. 
In the EW $qqH$ categories, the same DNN is used as final discriminant as in the nominal SRs. Studies found no improvements when using different DNNs trained separately for different STXS regions.
All signal categories to which the analysis is not sensitive are fixed to their SM predictions. 
The contribution of the different merged STXS bins in all reconstructed SRs is shown in \cref{fig:STXS_Composition}. 
It can be seen that the largest contribution in each SR comes from the STXS bin that is targeted.
