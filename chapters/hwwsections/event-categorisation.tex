\todo{Could either describe all SRs first (ggF,VBF) and then all bkg estimation techniques, OR do both for each analysis in a section. (Separate via process (signal or bkg) or via analysis (ggF vs VBF)?)}
- Including STXS binning
- Define ``vocabulary'' for regions, bins, categories, processes, ...

- STXS categorisation plot
- Expected event yields in each stxs region (or maybe later!?)

- Table of all regions entering the analysis? -> Checkout google doc! OR put in Stats model section
