% From nature
% The statistical analysis of the data relies on a likelihood formalism, where the likelihood functions describing each of the input measurements are multiplied to obtain a combined likelihood. The observed yield in each category of reconstructed events follows a Poisson distribution whose parameter is the sum of the predicted signal and background contributions. The predicted signal yield is split into the different production and decay processes, so it can be parameterized as a function of dedicated parameters of interest depending on the tested model.
