% The statistical analysis of the data relies on a likelihood formalism, where the likelihood functions describing each of the input measurements are multiplied to obtain a combined likelihood. The observed yield in each category of reconstructed events follows a Poisson distribution whose parameter is the sum of the predicted signal and background contributions. The predicted signal yield is split into the different production and decay processes, so it can be parameterized as a function of dedicated parameters of interest depending on the tested model.

% This chapter presents cross-section measurements of \HWWdet decays, with the Higgs boson produced via the ggF and VBF production mode, using the full dataset collected at \RunTwo of the LHC. 
% Prior measurements of these processes were performed by the ATLAS collaboration. 
% Using data from \RunOne of the LHC the \HWW process was established by reporting its observation with a discovery significance of 6.1 standard deviations~\cite{HIGG-2013-13}. 
% An analysis using a partial \RunTwo dataset reported ggF and VBF production cross sections times \HWW branching fractions of $11.4^{2.2}_{-2.1}$ pb and $0.50^{0.29}_{-0.28}$~\cite{HIGG-2016-07}.
% The analysis presented here uses the full \RunTwo dataset and in addition to the increase in dataset size implements several improvements compared to the previous \RunTwo results. Most noteworthy, the discrimination of the VBF signal is performed using a deep neural network (DNN) instead of a boosted decision tree, ggF events with two or more jets in the final state are included in the measurement, and measurements of cross sections in the kinematic regions defined in the STXS framework are reported for the first time using \HWW events~\cite{HWWPaper}. 
% The analysis is published in \ccite{HWWPaper} and yields some of the most precise Higgs cross-section meausurements to date.\footnote{Comparable results based on the full \RunTwo dataset have also been reported by the CMS collaboration~\cite{Sirunyan_2021}.}
% The results are also used as input to a combined Higgs boson measurement published in \ccite{NaturePaper} where they make an essential contribution.

% This is obseved:
% $11.4^{2.2}_{-2.1}$ pb and $0.50^{0.29}_{-0.28}$
% 12.0 ± 1.4 pb and 0.75 +0.19 −0.16 pb,

- The results presented for the first time report STXS cross section measurements. 

- Observation of the VBF production mode for the first time in a single channel, made possible by the development of deep neural network that provides excellent discrimination of the VBF signal with a signal-to-background ratio of more to 2. 

Compared to previous \RunTwo results, the relative uncertainty on the corresponding ggF and VBF production cross-section measurements was reduced by almost 40\% and 60\% respectively.
