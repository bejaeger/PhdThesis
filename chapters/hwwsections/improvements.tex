A better understanding of parton shower effects and more accurate theoretical calculations are needed to improve the measurements in future iterations.~\cite{Jger2020} 

Changes in analysis to estimate uncertainties more robustly
% From Carsten:
% There, the greater statistical power of the data set will enable the use of more advanced techniques of analysis and background estimation to better control the systematic uncertainties and facilitate precise measurements of differential cross sections in the future.

Analysis strategy

Extended use of machine learning algorithms 

- DNN in ggF categories
- Improvement of ggF 2-jet and VBF 2-jet separation with multiclass classification.
