%The different production and decay modes of the Higgs boson were discussed in \cref{subsec:higgschannels}.
This section first discusses the characteristics of the signal processes analyzed and then details the processes that mimic these signal signatures and therefore must be considered as backgrounds.

\subsection{The Signal Processes}
\label{subsec:signal-bkg-characterisation}
The Feynman diagrams of the ggF and VBF signal processes are shown in \cref{fig:feyn:sig-wwprod}.
The features of the \HWWdet decay and the production mechanisms are discussed below. They are the basis for the event categorization discussed in \cref{sec:event-categorization}.

\subsubsection{The \HWWdet decay}
The Higgs boson couples to a pair of oppositely charged $W$ bosons.
Because of the high mass of the $W$ boson ($m_W = 80.354 \pm 0.007\,\GeV$ \cite{PDG2020}), one of the vector bosons is produced on shell, the other is virtual.
Because the $W$ bosons are short-lived ($\tau \approx \mathcal{O}(10^{-25}\,\text{s})\,\text{\cite{PDG2020}}$), only their decay products can be measured. The decay modes including their branching ratios are shown in \cref{fig:w-branching-ratios}. This analysis targets \Wboson boson decays into \emph{light leptons} (simply referred to as leptons in the following), that is, electrons and muons and their associated neutrinos.
As discussed in more detail in \cref{sec:object-selection}, the presented analysis targets \HWW decays that exhibit one electron and one muon in the final state. 
% Belongs more to object selection!

    \label{fig:w-branching-ratios}
\end{figure}
%It can be assumed that the Higgs boson is produced at rest, so that the two \Wboson bosons are emitted in opposite directions in the transverse plane. 
%For this reason, and because of the property of the electroweak interaction to couple only to left-handed neutrinos as well as angular momentum conservation, the \HWWdet process exhibits a distinct kinematic feature that can be exploited in the event selection.
%It arises as a direct consequence of angular momentum conservation and the property of the electroweak interactions to only couple to left-handed neutrinos. 

The \HWWdet decay exhibits a distinct kinematic feature that can be exploited in the event selection.
The spin projections of the \Wboson bosons must sum to zero, because the Higgs boson has a spin of zero and angular momentum must be conserved.
Similarly, the leptons from the \Wboson decays must have spin projections that are aligned. Because the \Wboson couples only to left-handed neutrinos, this ultimately leads to an enhanced fraction of \HWWdet events in which the two leptons are emitted in the same direction at small angle \dphill.
\Cref{fig:spin-correlations} illustrates this by showing the different spin configurations possible, including the resulting final state kinematics.\footnote{This provides a slightly simplified picture that disregards interference effects between different \Wboson boson polarisation states. When they are considered, however, similar conclusions can be drawn~\cite{Maina_2021}.}
As a consequence, several observables that are correlated to the angular separation between the leptons can be exploited to discriminate between \HWW decays and other background events. For example, the mass of the dilepton system,
\begin{equation}
    \Mll = \sqrt{\left| \Ptll \right|^2+ \left( E_{\ell\ell} \right)^2},
\end{equation}
is more likely to take smaller values, and the magnitude of the vectorial sum of the \pT of both leptons,
\begin{equation}
    \Ptll = |\pmb{p}_\text{T}^{\ell_1} + \pmb{p}_\text{T}^{\ell_2}|,
\end{equation}
is expected to take larger values due to the angular correlations.

The presence of the neutrinos in the final state has two important consequences:
First, they lead to events with significant missing transverse energy. This is amplified by the angular correlations described above, as the neutrinos are more likely to be emitted in the same direction. This feature can be especially well exploited by the \METSig observable.
Second, not enough information is available about the longitudinal momentum of the Higgs boson in order to reconstruct its full mass. The mass of the Higgs boson can therefore only be reconstructed in the transverse plane, which is calculated as
\begin{equation}
  \Mt = \sqrt{ \left( E_{\ell\ell}+\MET \right)^2 - \left| \Ptll + \pmb{E}_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}} \right|^2 },
\end{equation}
where $E_{\ell\ell} = \sqrt{ \left|\Ptll\right|^2 + \Mll^2}$ is the energy of the lepton system.

The spin projections of the $W$ bosons sum to zero and they decay into leptons with aligned spin projections. This results in an enhanced fraction of events with leptons that have a small opening angle as well as two neutrinos being emitted in opposite directions. Taken from Ref.~\cite{HIGG-2013-13}.}
    \label{fig:spin-correlations}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The VBF and ggF production modes}
The signature of the final state also depends on the production mode of the Higgs boson.
In the VBF production mode, two energetic jets are expected in the final state that are predominantly emitted in the forward direction and have a large invariant mass \mjj. 
The difference between the two jet rapidities, \dyjj, is expected to be large and because the mediating weak bosons from the \HWW decay do not exchange gluons, the hadronic activity between the jets is expected to be small. 
The latter can be quantified by the \emph{lepton centrality} variable, $C_\ell$, that compares the $\eta$ positions of the leptons with the corresponding values for the jets with $C_\ell = |2\eta_\ell - \sum \eta_j| / \Delta \eta_{jj}$. It is expected that VBF, \HWW events cause smaller $C_\ell$ values than other processes.
These prominent features clearly distinguishes VBF, \HWW events from events produced via the ggF production mode, where no additional jets are expected at leading order. Additional jets may, however, still arise (for both production modes) due to ISR and FSR. 

\subsubsection{Other Higgs channels}
In this analysis, the contributions to \HWW events from other Higgs production modes, such as $VH$ or $ttH$, are marginal because of both their small cross sections and the fact that they have additional particles in the final state based on which their contributions can be suppressed.
% events can be efficiently rejected.
Events where the Higgs boson decays into a pair of $\tau$ leptons have similar final states as the \HWWdet\ decays when the $\tau$ leptons decay leptonically. 
Because of the low branching ratios of both the $H \to \tau\tau$ decays and $\tau$ decays into muons or electrons ($\approx$ 17-18 \% \cite{PDG2020}), contributions from $H \to \tau\tau$ processes are also small in this analysis. 
The analysis presented is therefore sensitive only to the ggF and VBF production modes of the \HWWdet\ decay. Contributions from above-mentioned other Higgs channels are treated like backgrounds and normalized to their corresponding SM predictions.

\subsection{The Background Processes}
Example Feynman diagrams for the most important backgrounds are shown in \cref{fig:hww:feyn-bkgs}.
Their impact in the different signal categories varies, depending on the final state particles, their kinematics, and their production cross-section.

    }
    \caption{Representative leading order Feynman diagrams for all major backgrounds in the \HWW analysis.} 
    \label{fig:hww:feyn-bkgs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Continuum $WW$ background}
The non-resonant (or \emph{continuum}) $WW$ background is dominated by quark-initiated $WW$ processes (labelled $qq \to WW$) with only a small contribution coming from gluon-initiated processes ($gg \to WW$). 
The production of two $W$ bosons gives rise to final states that mimic the ggF signal process, rendering this background irreducible. 
It also contributes to the analysis of VBF, \HWW events when additional jets are present due to radiation. 
A suppression of the $WW$ background can still be achieved by exploiting the distinct kinematics of the signal. For example, the $\mll$ observable tends to have a broader distribution for the non-resonant $WW$ processes compared to the signal. 
Another difference is that both $W$ bosons are produced on-shell in contrast to the signal process. 
This leads to the fact that the lepton \pT tends to be larger for the continuum $WW$ processes than for the signal processes.
\todo{double-check the last statement}


\subsubsection{EW $WW$ background}
The contribution from $WW$ bosons produced via electroweak interactions (EW $qq \to qqWW$) is generally small, due to a small production cross section. However, the EW $WW$ production has a very similar signature as the VBF signal process, resulting in a significant contribution at large \mjj, where other background processes do not contribute as much. 
It therefore constitutes a major background for the measurement of the VBF signal. 
%at large $m_{jj}$ the contribution can be significant relative to other background processes that fall much more steeply with increasing $m_{jj}$. 

\subsubsection{Top-quark backgrounds}
Collision events involving top quarks are abundant at $pp$ colliders because of their large production cross section, making them a major background in this analysis.
Processes with top quarks, collectively denoted as top-quark background, can be separated into $t\bar{t}$ processes, involving two top quarks, or processes with only a single top quark. 
The single-top process relevant for this analysis is characterised by a $W$ boson radiated off a single top quark (labelled as $Wt$). 
The top quark decays into a $b$-quark and a $W$ boson in more than 99\% of cases~\cite{PDG2020}. 
This gives rise to two $W$ bosons in the final state, mimicking the signal processes. 
However, the $b$-jets that are present in top-quark events can be used to reject top-quark events efficiently.
% Since the $b$-jet identification is not perfect and the production cross section of top processes is large, top processes represents a major background. 

\subsubsection{\Ztautau\ background}
$Z$ bosons are produced with large cross sections at the LHC. The processes relevant for the this analysis are Drell-Yan (DY) processes and $Z$ production in association with jets (together labelled as \Zgamma).
The $Z$ boson decays with equal probabilities ($\approx$ 3.4\%~\cite{PDG2020}) into a pair of electrons, muons, or taus. 
This analysis specifically selects events with two leptons of different flavor, to minimize the otherwise large contamination from $\Zgamma \to ee$ and $\Zgamma \to \mu\mu$ processes. Only in rare cases does the event signature resemble the signal, for example, if one of the two leptons of the same flavor cannot be identified and a jet is misidentified as a lepton.
The \Ztautau\ process, in contrast, constitutes a substantial background as the tau leptons can further decay into electrons or muons and their associated neutrinos, giving rise to final states similar to the ones of the signal processes. 
The \Ztautau\ background can be suppressed effectively, if the $Z$ bosons are produced at rest, which is a good approximation for events with \ZeroJet. In these cases, the neutrinos from the tau decays are emitted in opposite directions, resulting in a small \MET, and for the same reason, the leptons are expected to have a large opening angle, which is contrary to the signal signature. 
If the $Z$ boson is produced with a significant transverse momentum, for example in cases where the $Z$ boson recoils against a jet, the \MET may be sizeable and the opening angle of the leptons is not necessarily large. 
Suppressing the \Ztautau\ background thus becomes more difficult in the \OneJet and \TwoJet categories. 

\subsubsection{$W$+jets and multijet background}
Processes with $W$ bosons in association with a jet (\Wjets) as well as multijet processes do not contain the same final state particles as the signal processes. However, they can contaminate the analysis regions if one or more of the reconstructed physics objects is misidentified as an isolated prompt lepton. 
Although such misidentifications are very rare, the $W$+jets and multijet production are sizeable backgrounds in this analysis due to their large production cross section.
%The $W$+jets process, shown in \cref{FIGURE}, is especially important because it requires only one physics object to be misidentified for it to mimic the final state of the signal process.
%\todo{Write the above a bit more clearly. If the jet from the W+jets process is misidentified as a lepton that's it!}
Misidentifications arise from two main sources: jets that are misidentified as isolated leptons, or from non-prompt leptons from heavy hadron decays within jets that are also misidentified as isolated leptons.
The rate at which these misidentifications occur is difficult to estimate purely based on simulated event samples. For this reason, a dedicated data-driven method known as \emph{fake factor method} is used to estimate the background with misidentified leptons. Details are given in \cref{subsec:misid-bkg}.

% The detector signature of such events can be extremely similar to the signal process, making it difficult to reduce this background via selections on event observables.

\subsubsection{Other diboson and other backgrounds}
Aside from $WW$ production, other diboson processes, labelled as \emph{Other} $VV$, can contaminate the analysis regions. 
The $WZ$, $ZZ$, and $W\gamma*$ processes can mimic the signal, if leptons or jets are lost in the reconstruction. 
$W\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ processes (together denoted $V\gamma$) can mimic the signature of the signal processes, if the photon is misidentified as an electron. This may occur, if the photon converts to an electron-positron pair and is reconstructed as a single isolated lepton. 
Since the reconstruction and identification efficiencies are reasonably high, the Other $VV$ background is small in this analysis.
The same is true for processes involving three bosons (called \emph{triboson} processes), which contribute only marginally to the analysis regions because of their additional final state particles as well as their overall small production cross section.
