Mention for fit that:
% For the background categories that can be measured well in a region pure in events of that category, the NFs are typically freely floating in the statistical analysis. For the other background categories the values are fixed to $\nu_\beta = 1$. 
%Typically, these are the \emph{parameters of interest} (POIs) in the statistical analysis.


% Combination:

% From nature:
% The statistical analysis of the data relies on a likelihood formalism, where the likelihood functions describing each of the input measurements are multiplied to obtain a combined likelihood. The observed yield in each category of reconstructed events follows a Poisson distribution whose parameter is the sum of the predicted signal and background contributions. The predicted signal yield is split into the different production and decay processes, so it can be parameterized as a function of dedicated parameters of interest depending on the tested model.
