which is consistent with the SM prediction of $10.4\pm 0.5$~pb and $0.81\pm 0.02$~pb for ggF and VBF~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}, respectively.

The SM expectation lies well within the 68\% and 95\% confidence level contours.

where $11.3\pm 0.5$~pb are expected from the SM predictions.
\Cref{fig:couplings-POIs} summarizes the results of the inclusive cross-section measurements by presenting the ratio of the cross sections measured divided by the corresponding value predicted by the SM.

The uncertainties broken down into several components for the inclusive cross section measurements are shown in \cref{tab:UncertaintyBreakdown_2-POI}. 
The systematic uncertainties dominate the measurements. 
For the ggF measurement, the theoretical uncertainties are of similar size as the experimental uncertainties.
The VBF measurement is dominated by theory uncertainties, in particular VBF signal modelling uncertainties.
The latter is mainly caused by uncertainties related to the modelling of potential jets in addition to the two leading jets, manifesting itself in a large uncertainty due to the choice of parton shower model (see also \cref{subsec:expected-performannce}). The largest contributions from the backgrounds are from uncertainties due to the modelling of top-quark processes, $WW$ production, and the ggF process that can be considered a background in the VBF measurement.

    The individual sources of systematic uncertainties are grouped together.
    The sum in quadrature of the individual components differs from the total uncertainty due to correlations between the components.

\subsection{STXS measurement}
%The results obtained for the cross sections times branching fraction in 11 STXS bins are summarized in \cref{fig:11-POI_measurement}. 
The results obtained for the 11 STXS cross sections times branching fraction are summarized in \cref{fig:11-POI_measurement}. 
They are in agreement with the SM predictions, with a $p$-value of 53\%.
The presentation of more detailed results is left to Appendix~\ref{app:stxs-measurement}. 
The majority of $ggH$ cross-section measurements (4/6) are dominated by systematic uncertainties, with the background and experimental uncertainties making on average the largest contribution. 
The measurements of EW~$qqH$ production are mostly dominated by statistical uncertainties (4/5). 

% The cross sections measured for the five STXS bins targeting EW~$qqH$ production are on average lower than the VBF cross section measured in the two-POI fit. Events with high $\mjj$ or high $\pTH$ carry a larger statistical weight than events at low $\mjj$ in the two-POI fit, and in these STXS bins the measured value is close to one.
\Cref{fig:STXS-correlation} shows the correlations between the cross sections measured. 
Due to migrations of signal events from a particular STXS bin to multiple reconstructed SRs, the correlations are sizable but small. The maximum value is around 30\% between the high \pTH SRs of the two \TwoJet categories, where the separation at reconstruction-level between STXS bins is particularly difficult. This can also be seen in \cref{sec:event-categorization}, \cref{fig:STXS_Composition}.

\subsection{Post-fit distributions and signal excess}
Post-fit distributions are presented that show the expected yields when all parameters are set to their corresponding post-fit values. They also take properly into account all systematic uncertainties. \Cref{fig:VBF_DNN} shows the post-fit DNN output distribution in the VBF SR as obtained from the 2-PoI fit.
The VBF signal can be well separated from the backgrounds up to a signal-to-background ratio of more than two in the DNN bin with the largest DNN output.
The VBF signal is observed with a discovery significance of $5.8\,\sigma$, where $6.2\,\sigma$ were expected.
% The observed (expected) VBF signal reaches a significance of $5.8\sigma$ ($6.2\sigma$) above the background expectation.
The post-fit \mT distributions in the different ggF SRs as well as in the combined region are shown in \cref{fig:ggF_MT}.
The ggF events with two jets in the final state are measured with a discovery significance of $2.2\,\sigma$, where $1.6\,\sigma$ were expected. In this fit, the VBF contribution is fixed to the SM prediction.

Representative post-fit distributions for the STXS measurements are shown in \cref{fig:aux:VBF-STXS-SRs}, corresponding to VBF STXS SRs targeting EW~$qqH$ production. 
Especially in the high \mjj bins, the measured VBF signal is very prominent above the backgrounds. 

For all distributions shown, the observed yields agree in both shapes and rates with the SM expectations.
Similarly, post-fit distributions of other observables were studied and are found in excellent agreement with their expectations. The post-fit distributions of the final discriminants in the CRs are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:post-fit-cr-dists}.

% From paper:
% The measurements are dominated by systematic uncertainties.
% For the ggF measurement, uncertainties from experimental and theoretical sources are comparable.
% For the VBF measurement, signal theory uncertainties make up the largest contribution and the dominant ones are those related to the modeling of potential jets in addition to the tagging jets.
