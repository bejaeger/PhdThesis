% From Master's thesis:
The SM of particle physics is a collection of relativistic quantum field theories (QFT) and describes the interactions between all known fundamental particles.
%It evolved during the 60’s and 70’s due to a strong interplay between experimental observations and theoretical developments. 

- Introduction to QFT and gauge group

- Lagrangian formalism
- local gauge invariance: without local gauge invariance:
% From Pich The Standard Model
% Thus, once a given phase convention has been adopted at one reference point x0, the same convention must be taken at all space-time points. This looks very unnatural.
- highly successful in describing QED

\subsection{Particles and Forces}
\label{sec:particle-content}
%In QFT all fundamental fields have an associated particle, that can be thought of as excitations (or vibrations) of the fields.
On a \TDnote{phenomenological}{other word?} level, fundamental physics can be described in terms of elementary particles and forces.

The SM includes three of the four known fundamental interactions: The \emph{electromagnetic interaction} -- described by the theory of \emph{quantum electrodynamics} (QED) --, the \emph{strong interaction} -- using \emph{quantum chromodynamics} (QCD) [15] -- and the \emph{weak interaction}. The electromagnetic and the weak interaction are unified in the \emph{electroweak model} [16–18]. The fourth known fundamental interaction, \emph{gravitation}, is not part of the SM but can be fully neglected in present particle physics experiments due to its weak strength.

% All currently known particles and forces included in the SM are listed in \TDnote{REF}{REF}.
The elementary particles included in the SM are listed in \TDnote{REF}{REF}. They can be grouped into two main types: \emph{fermions}, that are sometimes referred to as \emph{matter particles} carrying half-integer spin, and \emph{bosons}, that are the \emph{mediators} (or \emph{force carriers}) of the fundamental forces carrying integer spin.

The fermions can be further divided into a set of six leptons and six quarks, each of which can be classified into three generations.
Their interactions with each other can be described by exchanges of so-called \emph{gauge bosons}.
Every fermion has a corresponding antiparticle that has the same mass and spin but opposite internal quantum numbers and opposite \emph{chirality}.
Quarks have an additional property called \emph{colour}, which can take three possible values or any linear combinations of these values.

The boson that mediates the electromagnetic interaction is the massless \emph{photon} that interacts with all charged fermions.
The strong interaction is transmitted via eight massless gluons and acts only on quarks and gluons themselves.
Due to the property of \emph{confinement} in QCD, quarks cannot be found in isolation. They are confined within hadrons that consist, for example, of a quark and an anti-quark (known as \emph{mesons}) or three quarks (known as \emph{baryons}).

The massive gauge bosons, \Wplus, \Wminus, and \Zboson, are the mediators of the weak interaction which acts on all fermions. As well, the \Wmp and \Zboson undergo self-interactions.

The final particle of the SM is the electrically neutral \emph{Higgs boson}. It is the only spin-0 scalar particle and plays a special role in the SM in the mechanism of \emph{electroweak symmetry breaking}, which gives rise to the masses of the \Wpm and \Zboson bosons. More details about Higgs boson physics are provided in \TDnote{REF}{REF}.


\subsection{Formalism and Principles}
% - Action: S = Int ( Lagrangian ) dt -> EOMs
% - Lagrangian = Int (Lagrange density ) d3x
% -> Lagrange density is commonly referred to as Lagrangian 
% - In QFT, we define EOMs for fields by specifying the Lagrange density (Lagrangian)

% Particles can be thought of as excitations (or vibrations) of corresponding fundamental fields. 
QFT describes nature in terms of fundamental fields. Each field has an associated particle that can be thought of as excitations (or vibrations) of the fields.\footnote{To simplify terminology, the objects are mostly referred to as particles rather than fields in this chapter, but the relationship is important to be kept in mind.}

The equations of motions of a given physical system can be derived from the action,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:action}
  S = \int \Lagrangian \quad d^3x dt,
\end{equation}
by following the action principle.\footnote{The derivation can be found in any standard text QFT such as REF (Peskin schroeder?).}.
In QFT, the dynamics of a system are therefore expressed in terms of the Lagrange densities (often just denoted \emph{Lagrangian}), \Lagrangian. 

The Lagrangian is a function of the fields, $\psi$, and their derivatives, $\partial \psi$, that is $\Lagrangian \rightarrow \Lagrangian\left(\psi, \partial\psi)\right)$. The fields are themselves dependent on the space-time coordinate, $\psi \rightarrow \psi(x)$. 
For a given field, $\psi$, the principles of QFT demand to include all possible terms in the Lagrangian related to the field. 
The number and type of terms that can be included, however, is strongly constraint by requiring the theory to be invariant under certain symmetry transformations of the fields. 
The SM is governed by the principle of \emph{local gauge invariance}. 

It implies, that the physical content of the theory should stay the same when performing certain re-definitions of the particle fields independently at every space-time point.
The structure of the Lagrangian is therefore determined by requiring invariance under field transformations of the sort,
\begin{equation}
  \psi \rightarrow e^{-i\omega(x)} \psi,
\end{equation}
where $\omega(x)$ is the generator of a certain symmetry group and dependent on the space-time coordinate. 
In order to maintain the symmetry, the Lagrangian may need to be manipulated by introducing new fields.
These fields are known as gauge fields (or gauge bosons) and give rise to particle interactions that give rise to the fundamental forces of nature. 
Historically, the first local gauge theory that was established was QED. It follows a U(1) local gauge symmetry and entails the photon as the associated gauge field. 
The SM is a reflection of a SU(3)$_C$ $\times$ SU(2)$_L$ $\times$ U(1)$_Y$ local gauge symmetry that implies the existence of the gauge bosons described in the previous section.

The following sections break down the full Lagrangian of the SM in different parts. 

Throughout this thesis, natural units are used, that is $c = \hbar = 1$. This means that the mass, momentum and energy are all given in units of electronvolt (\eV).
- Terms with equal indices are considered to be summed (Einstein-summation convention) and greek letters go from 1-4 and latin letters from 1-3 if not mentioned otherwise.

- renormalization:
We consider that the physics is understood up to a given cut-off/scale Lambda.

%The SM is governed by the principle of local gauge invariance and the associated symmetry group is SU(3)$_C$ $\times$ SU(2)$_L$ $\times$ U(1)$_Y$. 

% the next important lesson is that the existence of these symmetries places suck an incredibly strong constraint on what the theory actually is.

% QED: demanding all the terms in your Lagrangian being gauge invariant is enforcing the conservation of electric charge gauge

% Sean Carrol:

%the existence of these fields giving rise to interactions giving rise to forces of nature comes from the gauge symmetry.
% the next important lesson is that the existence of these symmetries places suck an incredibly strong constraint on what the theory actually is.

% From Master thesis
% An essential part of the mathematical formulation of the SM is based on the postulation of local gauge invariance. It implies, that the physical content of the theory should stay the same when performing certain redefinitions of the particle fields independently at every space-time point. The SM follows a SU(3)×SU(2)L×U(1)Y symmetry group, where SU(3) is the gauge group of QCD and SU(2)L×U(1)Y the corresponding symmetry for the electroweak model (the meaning of the subindizes L and Y will be explained in the following sections). Historically, QED was the first well established gauge theory, following a U(1) symmetry. To demonstrate the principles of a gauge theory, which are the key concepts of the mathematical framework of the SM, the QED Lagrangian will be derived in the following. Subsequently the same principles are applied to describe the main aspects of the more complex theories of QCD and the electroweak model. A description of the mechanism to incorporate masses for the W± and Z bosons via breaking the electroweak symmetry is given thereafter. The following sections follow to a large extend the more detailed descriptions given in Refs. [19–21].


\subsection{Quantum electrodynamics}
%The above derivations are shortly recapped: Starting from the Lagrangian of a freely moving relativistic fermion one can impose the requirement of local U(1) gauge invariance. This demands to add a new field $A_\mu$ toghether with an interaction term, which is incorporated in the Lagrangian by introducing a covariant derivative $D_\mu$. Additionally, the kinetic term in \cref{eq:kinetictermqed} needs to be added for the new field, which leads to the final Lagrangian for QED, shown in \cref{eq:Lagrangianqed}.
QED is the reflection of an underlying $U(1)$ local gauge symmetry of the complex-valued fermion fields, $\psi_f$, known as \emph{Dirac spinors}.
The Lagrangian that is invariant under $\psi_f \rightarrow e^{i \omega(x)} \psi_f$ transformations can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{QED}} = \sum_f \bar{\psi_f}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m_f)\psi_f - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu},
  \label{eq:Lagrangianqed}
\end{equation}
where the sum goes over all electrically charged fermions with mass $m_f$.
Here, $D_\mu$ is the \emph{covariant derivative}, defined as
\begin{equation}
  D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ieA_\mu,
\end{equation}
which includes the gauge field $A_\mu$, associated with the photon. The requirement of local gauge symmetry prohibits terms quadratic in $A_\mu$, which reflects the fact that the photon is massless.\footnote{Terms in the Lagrangian that are quadratic in a certain field give rise to particle masses.}
The so-called \emph{field tensors} are defined as
\begin{equation}
  F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu,
\end{equation}
where $\gamma^\mu$ refers to the four $4x4$ gamma matrices, and $\partial_\mu$ are the partial derivatives.

According to Noether's theorem\TDnote{REF}{REF} each symmetry of a system results in a conserved quantity.
The symmetry group associated to QED is denoted U(1)$_{\text{QED}}$ and the conserved quantity is the electric charge.
It should be noted that U(1)$_{\text{QED}}$ is not part of the original symmetry group of the SM. As explained below, U(1)$_{\text{QED}}$ arises from a SU(2)$_L$ $\times$ U(1)$_Y$ symmetry that is spontaneously broken.


\subsection{Quantum chromodynamics}
QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory associated to the SU(3)$_C$ symmetry. The subindex $C$ refers to the colour and is the conserved quantity under SU(3)$_C$ transformations.
The local gauge invariant QCD Lagrangian reads
\begin{equation}
  %  \mathcal{L}_{\text{QCD}} = -\frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}^aG^{a\,\mu\nu} + \bar{q}^i\left( i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-m \right)^j_i q_j,
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{QCD}} = \sum_f \bar{\psi_f}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m_f)\psi_f - \frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}^aG^{a\,\mu\nu},  \label{eq:lqcd}
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all quark fields, $\psi_f$, where the fields are represented as spinor triplet. 
The covariant derivate is given by
\begin{equation}
    D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i g_s \frac{\lambda^a}{2} G_\mu^a,
\end{equation}
which includes the eight gluon fields $G_\mu^a$ (with $a = 1, \ldots, 8$), as well as the strong coupling constant, $g_s$, and the Gell-Mann matrices, $\lambda^a$, which are the generators of the SU(3)$_C$ group.
The field tensors, $G_{\mu\nu}^a$, are defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qcd-tensor}
  G_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu G_\nu^a - \partial_\nu G_\mu^a - g_s f^{abc}G_\mu^b G_\nu^c,
\end{equation}
where $f^{abc}$ are the structure constants of SU(3)$_C$. 
% Invariant under ... transformation, where ... are the group generators

The gluons are massless, as no term quadratic in the gluon fields are allowed when requiring local gauge invariance. Other than photons, however, gluons can interact with each other, a feature that arises from the non-commuting elements of the SU(3)$_C$ group. Triple and quartic self-interactions between gluons are therefore part of QCD because gluons themselves carry a combination of colour and anti-colour. 
%which is similar to the requirement of a massless photon in QED. 



\subsection{The electroweak model}
% - the chirality can be determined with... right-chiral fermions are singlets under SU(2)L transformations
% - This also means that no right-chiral neutrinos exist in the SM as they don't interact with any of the forces

% "Also called: The Glashow􏰁Weinb erg􏰁Salam Theory of Weak Interactions"
The weak and electromagnetic force are unified in the electroweak model developed by Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg \TDnote{REF}{REF}.
The unification is based on imposing local gauge invariance under transformations of the symmetry group
\begin{equation}
  \text{SU(2)}_L \times \text{U(1)}_Y.
\end{equation}
The subindex $L$ reflects the empirical finding that only \emph{left-chiral}\footnote{
  The \emph{chirality} of a fermion can be determined with the projection operators $P_L$ and $P_R$ like
  \begin{equation*}
    \psi       = P_L \psi + P_R \psi = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \gamma^5 \right) \psi + \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + \gamma^5 \right) \psi = \psi_R + \psi_L,                                \\
  \end{equation*}
  where $\gamma^5 = i\gamma^0\gamma^1\gamma^2\gamma^3$. The chirality becomes identical to the helicity for massless particles.
} (also denoted \emph{left-handed}) fermions interact via the weak interaction.
The fermions are therefore grouped into left-handed doublets and right-handed singlets under SU(2)$_L$ transformations, denoted $\psi_L$ and $\psi_R$, respectively. They transform as
\begin{align}
  \psi_L & \rightarrow e^{iY\omega} e^{iT^a\omega^a} \psi_L \\
  \psi_R & \rightarrow e^{iY\omega} \psi_R,
\end{align}
where $T^a = \frac{\sigma^a}{2}$ (with $a = 1, 2, 3$) are the generators of the SU(2)$_L$ group that are the Pauli matrices, $\frac{\sigma^a}{2}$, for SU(2)$_L$ doublets and zero for SU(2)$_L$ singlets. 
The associated conserved quantity is the \emph{weak isospin}, $T$, that is $T^3 = \pm \frac{1}{2}$ for SU(2)$_L$ doublets and $T^3 = 0$ for SU(2)$_L$ singlets.
The U(1)$_Y$ symmetry is associated to the \emph{hypercharge}, $Y$, and can not be directly associated to the QED gauge group.
The relation to the electromagnetic interaction and the physical electric charge $Q$ is
\begin{equation}
  Q = T^3 + \frac{Y}{2}.
\end{equation}
The local gauge invariant electroweak Lagrangian can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{EWK}} = \sum_f i\bar{\psi}_{f, L}\gamma^\mu D_\mu \psi_{f, L} + \sum_f i\bar{\psi}_{f, R}\gamma^\mu D_\mu \psi_{f, R} - \frac{1}{4}W_{\mu\nu}^aW^{a\,\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4} B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu}, 
  \label{eq:lagrangianewk}
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all fermions, $f$, whose occurrence as left-handed and right-handed particles is explicitly mentioned.
The covariant derivative is defined as
\begin{equation}
  D_\mu = \partial_\mu + igW_\mu^aT^a + ig'B_\mu \frac{Y}{2}
  \label{eq:covdevewk}
\end{equation}
and includes four gauge fields. The fields $W^a_\mu = W^1_\mu, W^1_\mu, W^3_\mu$ are the gauge fields of SU(2)$_L$ with associated coupling $g$ and $B_\mu$ is the gauge field of U(1)$_Y$ with coupling $g'$.
The field tensors are given by
\begin{align}
  W_{\mu\nu}^a & = \partial_\mu W_\nu^a - \partial_\nu W_\mu^a - g \epsilon^{abc} W^b_\mu W^c_\nu, \label{eq:Wtensor} \\
  B_{\mu\nu}   & = \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu,
\end{align}
where $\epsilon^{abc}$ are the structure constants of SU(2)$_L$. The third term on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:Wtensor} arises because of the non-abelian nature of SU(2)$_L$ and gives rise to triple and quartic self-interactions between the gauge fields $W_{\mu}^a$.
The tensor $B_{\mu\nu}$ has the same structure as the electromagnetic field strength tensor obtained in QED.

The Lagrangian in \cref{eq:lagrangianewk} describes 4 massless bosons. No terms quadratic in the vector fields are allowed due to the requirement of local gauge invariance. Moreover, also the simple inclusion of fermion mass terms is forbidden, given that a term
\begin{equation}
  -m_f \bar{\psi} \psi = -m_f \left( \bar{\psi_R}\psi_L + \bar{\psi_L}\psi_R \right)
  \label{eq:fermionmassterm}
\end{equation}
violates SU(2)$_L$ gauge invariance, since $\psi_L$ transforms as a doublet and $\psi_R$ as a singlet.

The physical fields, \Wpm, \Zboson, $\gamma$ naturally appear in the Higgs mechanism explained below.

% From experiments one expects two charged bosons $W^\pm$ and two neutral bosons, the $Z$ and the photon.


An overview of the fermion content of the electroweak model is shown in \cref{tab:ewfermioncontent}. Quarks undergoing the electroweak interaction are present as a mixture of the quark mass eigenstates. This phenomenon is described by the \emph{Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) mechanism} \cite{doi:10.1143/PTP.49.652}.









\subsection{Spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism}
\label{sec:ewsymbreaking}
- Local gauge invariance does not allow adding mass terms

- Need mechanism to generate mass terms.
- Spontaneous symmetry breaking can do that (Reference to anderson)
- The SU(2)$_L$ $\times$ U(1)$_Y$ symmetry is spontaneously broken into U(1)$_\text{QED}$

- This mechanism is spontaneous symmetry breaking
- Simply put, the Lagrangian itself maintains the symmetry, but the state of lowest energy is not invariant and breaks the summetry.

\end{figure}

An additional mechanism is needed in the SM to explain the finite masses of the weak gauge bosons. 
A principle known as \emph{spontaneous symmetry breaking}, that has been first explored in the field of condensed-matter physics \todo{REF, Anderson?}, can therefore be applied to the SM to generate the necessary mass terms without violating local gauge invariance.
This was observed by three independent research teams in 1960\todo{DATE}: Brout and Englert \cite{PhysRevLett.13.321}, Peter Higgs \cite{PhysRevLett.13.508,HIGGS1964132} and Guralnik, Hagan and Kibble \cite{PhysRevLett.13.585}.
The mechanism is known as the \emph{Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism} (or simply \emph{Higgs mechanism}) or also \emph{electroweak symmetry breaking} (ESWB).
The basic principle is to allow the state of lowest energy to violate gauge invariance while maintaining the gauge symmetry of the Lagrangian.

% was published almost simultaneously by three independent groups in 1964: by Robert Brout and François Englert;[3] by Peter Higgs;[4] and by Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble.[5][6][7]

The Higgs mechanism assumes a SU(2) doublet of complex scalar fields (in the following also denoted as \emph{Higgs doublet})
\begin{equation}
  \Phi = \myvec{ \Phi_\alpha \\ \Phi_\beta } = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \myvec { \Phi_1 + i \Phi_3 \\ \Phi_2 + i \Phi_4}
\end{equation}
and introduce the so-called \emph{Higgs potential}, illustrated in \cref{fig:higgspotential}, of the form
\begin{equation}
  V(\Phi) = \mu^2\Phi^\dagger\Phi + \lambda \left| \Phi^\dagger\Phi \right|^2,
  \label{eq:higgspotential}
\end{equation}
where the parameters are constraint to $\mu^2 < 0$ and $\lambda > 0$.
The Lagrangian 
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}} = |D_\mu\Phi|^2 - V(\Phi), % - \frac{1}{4} W_{\mu\nu}^a W^{a\, \mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu},
  \label{eq:lagrangianhiggs}
\end{equation}
with $D_\mu$ defined as shown in \cref{eq:covdevewk}, is invariant under local SU(2)$_L$ $\times$ U(1)$_Y$ transformations.
%% We find that the Lagrangian for such a field
%% \begin{equation}
%% \end{equation}
%% is invariant under global SU(2) phase transformations
%It is invariant under gauge transformations but not the ground state, which can be found at
The minimum of the potential has a finite value and can be found on the circle of minima where
\begin{equation}
  |\Phi| = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda} } \equiv \frac{ v }{\sqrt{2}}.
  \label{eq:higgsminima}
\end{equation}
Here, the \emph{vacuum expectation value} $v = \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{\lambda}}$ was introduced.
The symmetry is spontaneously broken when a ground state is chosen. 
%The arbitrary choice of a ground state is said to spontaneously break the symmetry. 

Without loss of generality the ground state can be chosen to be
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \myvec{0 \\ v},
  \label{eq:groundstate}
\end{equation}
that is $\Phi_1 = \Phi_2 = \Phi_4 = 0$ and $\Phi_3 = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}$, 
and expand the field $\Phi$ around it
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(x) = e^{i\frac{\phi(x)}{v}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \myvec{ 0 \\ v + H(x) }.
    \label{eq:higgsexp}
\end{equation}
The extra term of $e^{i\frac{\phi(x)}{v}}$ describes the fluctuations of the fields $\Phi_1, \Phi_2, \Phi_4$ from the vacuum $\Phi_0$.
Plugging \cref{eq:higgsexp} in the locally SU(2) invariant Lagrangian in \cref{eq:lagrangianhiggs} one can choose a specific gauge (the unitary gauge), where the three fields $\Phi_{1/2/4}$, that is $\phi(x)$, are not contained anymore. These fields are known as the \emph{Goldstone bosons} and have no physical implication. As shown in the following, they will reappear in the longitudinal polarization of the gauge bosons, which makes the gauge bosons become massive.
With these considerations the expanded field $\Phi$ can be reduced to
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \myvec{ 0 \\ v + H }
\end{equation}
%The generation of masses can be seen when
and inserted into the Lagrangian in \cref{eq:lagrangianhiggs}, which leads to the following kinetic term
\begin{align}
  |D_\mu\Phi|^2 & \supset \frac{1}{8} \left| \left( gW_\mu^a \sigma^a+g'B_\mu Y \right) \myvec{ 0 \\ v + H} \right|^2  \label{eq:lagrangianmasspre} \\
  % &= \frac{1}{8} \left| \left( g \myvec{ W_\mu^3 & W_\mu^1 - i W_\mu^2 \\ W_\mu^1 + i W_\mu^2 & W_\mu^3  } + g' B_\mu Y \right)  \myvec{ 0 \\ v + H } \right|^2 \\
  &= \frac{ \left( v + H \right) ^2}{8} \left[ g^2 \left( W_\mu^1 - i W_\mu^2 \right) \left( W_\mu^1 + i W_\mu^2 \right) + \left| g W_\mu^3 + g' B_\mu Y \right|^2 \right].
  \label{eq:lagrangianmass}
\end{align}
The gauge fields mix and one can redefine them to obtain the physical fields with the following linear combinations:
\begin{align}
  W_\mu^\pm &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( W_\mu^1 \mp iW_\mu^2 \right) \\
  Z_\mu &= \cos\theta_\text{w} W_\mu^3 - \sin\theta_\text{w} B_\mu \\
  A_\mu &= \cos\theta_\text{w} B_\mu - \sin\theta_\text{w} W_\mu^3.
\end{align}
Here $\theta_\text{w}$ is the so called \emph{weak mixing angle} with the definition $\sin\theta_\text{w}^2 = \frac{g'^2}{g^2+g'^2}$.
The following expression arises in the Lagrangian %quadratic in the gauge fields arise:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_M = \frac{1}{4} \left( v + H \right)^2  \left(g^2 W_\mu^+W^{-\,\mu} + \frac{g^2}{2\cos\theta_\text{w}^2} Z_\mu Z^\mu \right),
  \label{eq:lagrangianmasses}
\end{equation}
where the vacuum expectation value generates terms quadratic in the fields $W_\mu^\pm$ and $Z_\mu$. Identifying these terms with $M_W^2 W_\mu^+W^{-\,\mu}$ and $\frac{1}{2} M_Z^2 Z_\mu Z^\mu$ the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons have acquired the masses
\begin{equation}
  M_W = \frac{v g}{2}, \qquad  
  M_Z = \frac{v g}{2\cos\theta_\text{w}} = \frac{M_W}{\cos\theta_\text{w}}.
\end{equation}
No field quadratic in $A_\mu$ appears, which represents the fact that the photon is massless.

In summary, adding the Lagrangian in \cref{eq:lagrangianhiggs} - where a complex scalar Higgs doublet together with an appropriate Higgs potential is introduced - to the electroweak model in \cref{eq:lagrangianewk}, provides the description of the weak gauge bosons $W^\pm$ and $Z$ being massive.
Therefore, the Higgs potential is chosen such that it has a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value, which spontaneously breaks the symmetry. The arising three Goldstone bosons can be eliminated from the Lagrangian using its underlying local gauge symmetry. Therefore the unitary gauge is chosen, which results in three bosons acquiring a mass and the appearance of one remaining scalar field $H$. The photon remains massless, because the U(1)$_{\text{QED}}$ symmetry is unbroken.
%and choosing a specific gauge (the unitary gauge) the field $\Phi$ can be written as


The predicted scalar field $H$ is known as the \emph{Higgs boson}.
%Besides the Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble mechanism giving masses to the weak gauge bosons, it predicts a scalar field $H$, referred to as the \emph{Higgs boson}.
The kinetic term of the Lagrangian in \cref{eq:lagrangianhiggs} comprises the expression
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{H,self-coupling}} = \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu H \partial^\mu H - \mu^2 H^2 - \lambda v H^3 - \frac{1}{4} \lambda H^4,
  \label{eq:higgsselfcoupling}
\end{equation}
from which one can infer that the Higgs boson has a mass of
\begin{equation}
  M_H = \sqrt{2} \mu = \sqrt{2 \lambda} v.
\end{equation}
% The parameters of the Higgs potential $\mu^2 = \lambda v^2$ can be fixed for one combination by measuring parameters of the electroweak theory, but the physical Higgs mass can not be predicted. 
Moreover, the last two terms in \cref{eq:higgsselfcoupling} predict that the Higgs field couples to itself with cubic and quartic interactions.
The couplings of the Higgs boson to the weak gauge bosons are already expressed in \cref{eq:lagrangianmasses}. Rewriting this equation and inserting the respective mass definitions the expression for the boson couplings can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{H,boson-coupling}} = M_W^2 W_\mu^+W^{-\,\mu} \left( \frac{2H}{v} + \frac{H^2}{v^2} \right) + \frac{1}{2} M_Z^2 Z_\mu Z^\mu \left( \frac{2H}{v} + \frac{H^2}{v^2} \right).
  \label{eq:higgsbosoncoupling}
\end{equation}
The Higgs interactions are proportional to the mass squared of the coupled boson and there exist cubic ($V^\dagger VH$) and quartic ($V^\dagger VHH$) interaction terms.
While the Higgs boson was discovered experimentally in 2012 \cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012xdj}, and is by now seen in several different production and decay modes, the Higgs boson self-couplings are still searched for.
A more detailed descriptions on experimental Higgs boson physics and an overview of the current state of knowledge is given in \cref{sec:higgsphysics}.












\subsection{Fermion masses}
- The fermion masses are generated by interaction terms of the fermion fields and the Higgs field.
- This is possible because the left-chiral fermions appear as doublets under SU(2) transformations and can interact with the Higgs doublet.


\subsection{Renormalization}
% From modern particle physics book
% As shown by ‘t Hooft, only theories with local gauge invariance are renormalisable, such that the cancellation of all infinities takes place among only a finite number of interaction terms.

\subsection{Free parameters of the SM}
- SM makes predictions but some of the parameters are free

- 25 free parameters

- twelve Yukawa couplings

- three couplings constants: alpha, Gf, alphas (or g', gw, gs)

- two parameters describing higgs potential ($\mu$ and $\lambda$) or vev and higgs mass

- eight mixing angles of the PMNS and CKM matrices


- -> 14 of these are associated to the higgs field, eight with the flavour sector and only three with the gauge interactions

% From Brian but I think that is very useful to have here!

% Dickinson: In order to study physics at the highest energies and smallest distance scales, collider experiments focus on hard scatter interactions, in which there is a large momentum transfer (Q2) between two incident particles. 

% Dickinson Thesis:
% Perturbation theory: If the highest order term included in a calculation of   is linear in ↵S, the calculation is called “leading order” (LO). If the sum is completed up to the quadratic, cubic, or quartic term in ↵S, the calculation is called “next-to-leading order” (NLO), “next-to-next-to-leading order” (NNLO), or “next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order” (N3LO).
