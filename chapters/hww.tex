\subsection{Overlap removal}
\label{subsec:overlap-removal}

The inputs to the \emph{anti-$k_T$} algorithm are typically used also in other object reconstruction algorithms such as in the reconstruction of electrons and photons (see \cref{sec:electron-photon-reconstruction}).
To avoid double consideration of detector signals in the event reconstruction a dedicated procedure known as \emph{overlap removal} is performed in physics analyses that resolves these ambiguities. The procedure used for the work presented in this thesis is described in the relevant analysis chapter in \cref{subsec:overlap-removal}.
\Rinote{}{Not sure where exactly this belongs. Also need to make sure that this reflects the correct understanding of overlap removal}


\subsection{Pile-up reweighting}
In order to compare Monte Carlo simulated events with actual data, the amount of pile-up underlying the hard scatter needs to be account for.
To this end, a method known as \emph{pile-up reweighting} assigns a dedicated \emph{pile-up weight} to each event so that the average pile-up in simulated collision events match the actual running conditions. The reweighting procedure is performed separately for the data recorded in the years 2015 and 2016, 2017, and 2018.

\section{Classification of VBF Signal and Background Using a Deep Neural Network}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Copied from previous \section{Neural Network Training}
The work presented in this thesis uses supervised learning techniques to train a binary classifier that distinguishes between signal-like and background-like events. 
Therefore, only a single output node is required, that uses a logistic sigmoid as activation function such that $y = \sigma(x)$, where $\sigma(x)$ is defined as in \cref{eq:logistic-sigmoid}.
The network is trained with MC simulated $pp$ collision events that have ground-truth labels called \emph{target values} in the following. The target value, $t_n$, for a given event $n$ has a value of $t_n = 1$, if the event is a simulated signal event, and $t_n = 0$ otherwise.
