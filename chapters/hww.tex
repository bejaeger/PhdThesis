% Many different analyses were contributing to the big achievement of the experimental discovery of the Higgs boson in the year 2012 [5, 6]. The analysis of H → W±W∓∗ → `−  ̄ ν`+ν decays was an essential part of this success and nowadays still plays a major role in the Higgs boson physics programme at the LHC. This channel is so attractive because the Higgs boson decay into a pair of W bosons1 is the second most probable decay channel of the Higgs boson, with a branching fraction of 21.5%. By selecting leptons in the final state, additionally a good rejection power against background contributions is achieved.
Multiple physics analyses contributed to the great success of the experimental discovery of the Higgs boson in the year 2012. The analysis of \HWW decays was an essential part of this achievement. 
Ten years after this discovery, the Higgs boson can be studied with much higher precision using the data collected during \RunTwo of the LHC. 
This chapter presents precision cross-section measurements of \HWW decays, with the Higgs boson produced via the ggF and VBF production modes, using the 139\,\ifb\ $pp$ collision data at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13\,$TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment.
The cross sections are measured inclusively as well as differentially in various kinematic regions, following the STXS framework.
The analysis is published in \ccite{HWWPaper} and yields the most precise ggF and VBF Higgs boson cross-section measurements reported by the ATLAS collaboration to date.
The results are also used as input to a combined Higgs boson measurement of the ATLAS collaboration~\cite{NaturePaper} where they make an essential contribution. This is discussed in next chapter. 

% This chapter starts with briefly reviewing previous measurements of \HWW decays conducted with smaller datasets and outlining the objectives of the updated measurements presented in this chapter. 
This chapter begins with a brief motivation for conducting \HWW analyses and summarizing previous results.
\Cref{sec:analysis-overview} then provides an overview of the analysis.
The relevant signal and background processes are characterized in detail in \cref{sec:signal-bkg-characteristics}. 
\Cref{sec:data-mc-samples} summarizes the data set and simulated samples used.
\Cref{sec:object-selection} discusses the criteria used to select the physics objects in the final state, and \cref{sec:event-categorization} elaborates on how the events are selected and categorized. 
The background estimation techniques are explained in \cref{sec:bkg-estimation}. 
\Cref{sec:dnn} provides details on the development of the DNN deployed in the VBF, \HWW analysis. 
\Cref{sec:systematics} discusses the derivation of all systematic uncertainties. 
\Cref{sec:stats-analysis} explains the statistical analysis used to extract the VBF and ggF signals, and \cref{sec:hww-results} presents the final results of the measurements.
\Cref{sec:hww:summary} concludes with a summary and an outlook on possible future improvements.

It is worth noting that the author's biggest contribution was to the analysis of \HWW events produced via VBF. In what follows, more details are therefore provided on the aspects related to the analysis of the VBF signal.

% to cancel the $WW$ scattering divergencies. 
%This makes the \HWW\ decay of the Higgs boson particularly interesting to study. 
% This chapter presents the analysis of \HWWdet decays produced via the ggF and VBF production mode with data from \RunTwo of the LHC.
% The VBF, \HWW\ channel is particularly interesting, as it is the most sensitive channel to measure the $HWW$ couplings at the LHC.
