% From Master
% Many different analyses were contributing to the big achievement of the experimental discovery of the Higgs boson in the year 2012 [5, 6]. The analysis of H → W±W∓∗ → `−  ̄ ν`+ν decays was an essential part of this success and nowadays still plays a major role in the Higgs boson physics programme at the LHC. This channel is so attractive because the Higgs boson decay into a pair of W bosons1 is the second most probable decay channel of the Higgs boson, with a branching ratio of 21.5%. By selecting leptons in the final state, additionally a good rejection power against background contributions is achieved.

Several analyses contributed to the great success of the experimental discovery of the Higgs boson in the year 2012. The analysis of \HWWdet\ decays was an essential part of this achievement. 
The \HWW decay is the second most probable decay channel, with a branching ratio of 21.5\%~\cite{PDG2020}, and if final states with leptons are selected, good suppression of background contributions can be achieved.
This provides excellent opportunities for precision measurements of Higgs boson cross sections.
This chapter presents cross-section measurements of \HWWdet decays produced via the ggF and VBF production mode, using the full dataset collected at \RunTwo of the LHC. 
The analysis presented is published in \ccite{HWWPaper} and results in some of the most precise Higgs cross-section meausurements to date. 
They are also used as input to a combined measurement of various Higgs phenomena published in \ccite{NaturePaper}.

The Higgs boson discovery is mostly recognized as confirmation of the Higgs mechanism that provides masses to the vector bosons. 
It also solves another theoretical issue in the context of $WW$ scattering.
The cross section of the scattering of longitudinally polarized $W$ bosons ($W_LW_L \to W_LW_L$) diverges at high energies in the absence of the Higgs boson. In fact, the $WW$ scattering divergencies are cancelled only if the coupling of the Higgs boson to the $W$ bosons is exactly as predicted by the SM. Any observation of a different $HWW$ coupling would therefore require new physics to be introduced to keep the $WW$ scattering cross section finite. 
This provides extra motivation to study \HWW\ decays, in particular in their VBF production mode, as it is the most sensitive channel to measure the $HWW$ couplings at the LHC.

The analysis presented can be divided into four signal categories. Three categories target the ggF production mode (ggF signal) by separating events into a \ZeroJet, \OneJet, and \TwoJet category, and one category targets the VBF production mode (VBF signal), also requiring \TwoJet. 
As the author's biggest contribution was to the analysis of VBF, \HWW\ events, more details are provided on the VBF-related aspects throughout this chapter. 
After optimizing and validating the different categories separately, they are combined in a statistical combination to extract the signals.  
This chapter starts with briefly reviewing previous measurements of \HWW decays conducted with smaller datasets and outlining the objectives of the updated measurements presented in this chapter. 
The relevant signal and background processes are characterized in \cref{sec:signal-bkg-characteristics}. 
\Cref{sec:data-mc-samples} summarizes the data set and simulated samples used.
\Cref{sec:object-selection} discusses the criteria used to select the physics objects in the final state, and \cref{sec:event-categorization} outlines the details about how the events are selected and categorized. 
The background estimation techniques are explained in \cref{sec:bkg-estimation}. 
\Cref{sec:dnn} provides details on the development of a deep neural network to distinguish VBF, \HWW events from non-VBF events. 
\Cref{sec:systematics} discusses the derivation of all systematic uncertainties. 
\Cref{sec:stats-analysis} explains the statistical analysis that is used to extract the VBF and ggF signals, and \cref{sec:hww-results} presents the final results of the measurements.
\Cref{sec:conclusion} concludes this chapter.
