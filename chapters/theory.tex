\chapter{Theoretical Foundation}
\label{chap:theory}



- Section underlines the theoretical underpinnings that manifest the Higgs boson as a special place in the universe

- Lots of SM parameters are related to Higgs (SM stands and falls with Higgs)

- The SM also has limitations -> precision measurements of Higgs required

- Many models of new physics expect to have access to new physics through interactions with Higgs ()
