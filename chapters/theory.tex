\todo{More general introduction. Move the below to the SM section}

- Section underlines the theoretical underpinnings that manifest the Higgs boson as a special place in the universe

- Lots of SM parameters are related to Higgs (SM stands and falls with Higgs)

- The SM also has limitations -> precision measurements of Higgs required

- Many models of new physics expect to have access to new physics through interactions with Higgs ()

% From CARSTEN:
%This chapter outlines the Lagrange formulation of the Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics (SM), a successful framework to study the fundamental laws governing the universe. Special attention is devoted to the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). A more detailed introduction including all aspects of the model can be found in many textbooks [24â€“28].
