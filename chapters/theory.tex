% A crucial performance indicator of a particle accelerator is its \emph{instantaneous luminosity} $\mathcal{L}$ as it is proportional to the \emph{event rate}, 
% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}t} = \sigma_{P} \mathcal{L},
% \end{equation}
% for a given physics process $P$ with cross section $\sigma_{P}$.
% The instantaneous luminosity depends on parameters of the accelerator and is given by
% \begin{equation}
%   \mathcal{L} = f_rn_b\frac{N_p^2}{4\pi \sigma_x \sigma_y}, 
% \end{equation}
% when assuming Gaussian shaped beam profiles. Here, $f_r$ denotes the rotational frequency of the two bunches, $n_b$ the total number of bunches inside the accelerator, and $N_p$ the numbers of particles within each colliding bunch. 
% The total number of events after time $T$ is given after integrating with respect to time, 
% \begin{equation}
%   N_{\text{Events}} = \sigma_{P} \intLumi = \sigma_{P} \int_{0}^{T} \mathcal{L} \mathrm{d}t,
% \end{equation}
% and is a crucial quantity typically measured in high-energy-physics experiments. 
% It becomes clear that increasing the integrated luminosity \intLumi is one of the main goals of any collider experiment, as it is directly proportional to the number of expected events of a particular physics process. 

% Lumi defined by Mike:
% The luminosity measures the number of particles per unit area and time, and together with the probability of interaction (cross-section) determines the collision rate.


\subsection{Pile-up}
% Mention in Event Generation subsection, see Master thesis!

\Rinote{}{Where else should I talk about pile-up!? what is pile-up? HERE! Pile-up reweighting? analysis section. Pile-up as nuisance for jet measurements? -> JER calibration chapter, pile-up in LHC section as something intrinsic to pp collision event?}

->  Ruthmann has a nice section about it!
From Sommer: "Additional in- elastic, minimum-bias like pp collisions (pile-up) are generated using Pythia8 and overlaid."
Scope:
- I should explain concepts like luminosity blocks  / bunch spacing and stuff in Data Taking Section
- Then I can explain different pile-up conditions here.
- This will be valuable to understand the noise term measurement which exactly tries to measure the noise term!
- Also look back at discussion on skype with Brian about pile-up (actual mu vs average mu and so on)
