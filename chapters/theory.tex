\chapter{Theoretical Foundation}
\label{chap:theory}

This chapter presents the theoretical foundations that are relevant for this thesis.  
\Cref{sec:sm} outlines the mathematical framework of the Standard Model (SM), which currently provides the best theoretical framework to study the fundamental laws of nature. 
% The SM allows making predictions about the probabilities of various interactions between elementary particles. 
% These predictions can be tested, for example, with high-energy proton-proton ($pp$) collision events.
%<- maybe this in Intro of thesis?
\Cref{sec:anatomy} describes the phenomenology of high-energy proton-proton ($pp$) collision events and introduces the concepts necessary to describe and measure $pp$ interactions. 

% From CARSTEN:
%This chapter outlines the Lagrange formulation of the Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics (SM), a successful framework to study the fundamental laws governing the universe. Special attention is devoted to the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). A more detailed introduction including all aspects of the model can be found in many textbooks [24â€“28].

% From Master:
%This chapter is intended to give an overview of the theoretical foundations used in elementary particle physics that are relevant for this thesis. The basic mathematical concepts of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics are described in Section 2.1. The general principles of gauge theories and the mechanism of electroweak-symmetry-breaking leading to the prediction of the Higgs boson are briefly introduced. Section 2.2 summarizes the phenomenology at hadron colliders and introduces the concepts to describe proton-proton interactions. The different production and decay modes of the Higgs boson are finally discussed in Section 2.3 from a phenomenological point of view.
