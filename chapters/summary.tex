In the search for the fundamental laws of nature, the Higgs boson is a unique tool. 
It sits at the core of the Standard Model (SM). A theory that is known to be incomplete, or merely an approximation of a more fundamental theory. 

Ten years after the discovery of the Higgs boson, no experimental signs of deviations of the SM have formed. 

The physics program at the LHC provides the unique opportunity to measure the Higgs boson with unprecedented precision.

The most significant achievement was undoubtedly the discovery of the Higgs boson, which represents a true milestone in the history of particle physics. 

pushing the boundaries of technology and collaborative efforts and leaving no doubt about a huge experimental success.

% Nevertheless, the physics community seems to be slowly growing impatient, and it would be a miss not to mention that several physicists had hoped for the LHC program to provide more answers than it has delivered to date. 
% Several questions remain to be answered and no clear hints on where new physics may hide have been provided.
% In the case of theories beyond the SM such as supersymmetry, for example, it may be deemed disappointing rather than a success that no signs of it being realized in nature have been found so far. 
% In fact, this seems to be how it is often perceived from outside the physics community. 
% Whatever the framing might be, the LHC and its experiments have delivered outstanding results, pushing the boundaries of technology and collaborative efforts and leaving no doubt about a huge experimental success.
% In fact, if looking at physics for what it is, a fundamentally data-driven science, the LHC has done exactly as promised, providing a rich dataset to be explored. 
% From an experimentalist point of view, there is no doubt that the LHC including his experiments were a huge success.
%At the time of writing, 10 years after the Higgs boson discovery, it is therefore a good time to look at physics for what it is, a fundamentally data-driven science.

Guided by the data from full \RunTwo of the LHC, it is important to set out new research directions.
Since no signs of physics beyond the SM have been found to date, it is a crucial task to deepen our understanding of the physics we already know. 
A prime study is the one of the Higgs boson, which sits at the core of the SM and builds an important building block for many theories beyond the SM.
This thesis presented the study of Higgs bosons in their decays to $W$ bosons, providing measurements of unprecedented precision as well as resolution.

The analysis will be the baseline for many future combinations and reinterpretations such as in Effective Field Theories. 
The results were also crucial input to combined Higgs boson measurements that provide a comprehensive study of Higgs boson processes.


It is important to note that the analysis of the full \RunTwo dataset has not been completed. 
More results are imminent, aiming at an even more comprehensive experimental map of Higgs boson processes and other phenomena. 

Looking ahead, the data taking at the LHC is expected to continue at the turn of 2022 and 2023 with \RunThr, operating under similar data taking conditions as in \RunTwo. 
With more data the Higgs boson can be studied at even higher precision and new Higgs processes will become experimentally accessible. An example of the latter is the production of two Higgs bosons, allowing to probe the Higgs self coupling. 

After \RunThr, the LHC including its experiments will undergo a large-scale upgrade to be able to operate at very high-luminosities about \TDinote{200 times}{how much exactly?} larger than in \RunTwo. 
This will allow gathering data at a much increased rate, providing a dataset unprecedented in size.
The dataset is expected to correspond to 3000\ifb which will provide great potential for measuring tiny potential deviations from the SM and discovering new phenomena.
