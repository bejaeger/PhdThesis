\chapter{Measurement of the Noise Term of the Jet Energy Resolution}
\label{chap:calibration}

- Jets are complicated

- Both the non-compensating nature and the differences between electromagnetic and hadronic showers pose great challenges for calibrating the energy correctly.

- To correct for the loss of energy in a hadron shower, dedicated calibrations are performed typically at the level of the fully reconstructed objects.

%- Paper: paper presents the strategy used for the determination of the jet energy scale (JES) and resolution (JER) by the ATLAS experiment and its implementation as it pertains to the analysis of data from Run 2 of the LHC.

%- This publication focuses on calibrating jets reconstructed with the anti-ùëòùë° [1] algorithm with radius parameter ùëÖ = 0.4.

\section{Detector Response to Jets}
- As mentioned in \cref{chap:objects}, reconstructed clusters are calibrated at the EM scale.
- Hadronic showers cannot be captured and some signals are lost (non-compensating).
%Most secondary hadrons produced in the nuclear interactions are charged or neutral pions.
- A fraction of the energy of the particles participating in a hadronic shower cannot be captured due to several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Showering particles can transfer energy to atomic nuclei that are broken up during the interaction or remain in excited states.
    \item Showering particles can decay to non-interacting secondaries (for example in $\pi \rightarrow \mu \nu_\mu$) that escape the detector.
    \item Neutrons can be produced that undergo mostly elastic scattering and can thus escape the detector.
\end{itemize}
This phenomenon is known as \emph{non-compensating}.

Other factors contribute to energy losses:
- Dead material
- clustering inefficiencies
- non-accounted deposits: jet algorithm have a finite radius -> maybe there are deposits outside that cone coming from the original quark

- The e/h ratio, where e is the response to electromagnetic and h the response to hadronic interactions, is an important quantity


While the charged pions further interact hadronically, the neutral pions decay almost instantaneously into a pair of photons, that are more directly absorbed in the calorimeters. This results in a fraction of the hadronic shower being of electromagnetic nature.

R = e*fem(E) + h * (1 - fem(E)E)



\section{Jet Energy Corrections}

- Dandoy: "corrections derived from MC simluation and from data, the latter is referred to as \insitu calibraitions."

- Stages of calibration.
- Define different "scales"

-> reconstructed jets (EMTopo, pflow, rscan) -> constituent scale

-> pile-up subtracted scale

-> JES scale

-> GSC scale (only affects resolution, not JES on average! (discuss?))
% From DANDOY: The GSC shifts the energy of individual jets while maintaining the mean energy response derived in the previous jet energy scale calibration.    

-> in-situ calibration (only affects data! can keep this short as it does not affect JER measurements)

\Minote{}{Could make a table for the above and provide use cases for each scale}

- Definition of truth jets reconstructed using stable final-state particles
%Truth jets are reconstructed using stable final-state particles and exclude muons, neutrinos, and particles from pile-up interactions. Truth jets are selected with the same ùëùT > 7 GeV and |ùúÇ| < 4.5 thresholds as EMtopo and PFlow jets, and are geometrically matched to those jets using the angular distance ŒîùëÖ with the requirement ŒîùëÖ < 0.3.



An alternative approach to correct for energy losses is the so-called \emph{local hadronic cell weighting} (LCW), which applies energy corrections already at cluster level. Different variables can be defined to characterize a topo-cluster based on its shape and other properties. These observables, known as \emph{cluster moments}, are used to extract information about the hadronic signal content in a given cluster which in turn is used to correct the energy to the \emph{LCW scale}. More information can be found in \ccite{PERF-2014-07}.
\Minote{}{Maybe put entire Rscan studies in a nice appendix? Explaining new jet finding, LCW cluster usage, JES, results? -> I think that would make a lot of sense as I don't know too much about these jets!}

\section{Jet Energy Resolution}


\subsection{Contributing Effects and Parametrisation}
% From Karl Jakobs Slides
% For EM Calorimeter:
- Shower fluctuations: number of particles produced in a shower -> 1 / sqrt(E)
- Photo-electron statistics: inefficiencies converting photons to electrical signals -> 1/sqrt(E)
- Shower leakage: out of radius of jet or out of detector  -> constant
- sampling fluctuations: Number of low-energy electrons crossing active layers -> 1 / sqrt(E)

smaller effects:
- track length fluctuations
- landau fluctuations: asymptotic energy loss distribution for thin active layers is laundau instead of gaussian.

More effects from hadronic interactions:
- Fluctuations in EM fraction
- Fluctuations in neutron component
- Fluctuations in invisible energy
- Fluctuations in binding energy losses and nuclear excitation losses
- Fluctuations in the number of heavily ionizing particles

\subsection{Determination of the jet energy resolution in data}

- MC JES from fitting Gaussian to truth response EdetJES / Etruth in bins of Etruth

- JER scales with JES!!!
