% Learning From Experience: Measurement of HWW decays to two W bosons with a "learned" discriminator


% - To produce collision events at the highest energies, circular accelerators are built in order to gradually increase the energy of the particles.

% \Minote{}{Mention previous experiments? Tevatron, ...other?}

% The ATLAS experiment is operated by one of the world's largest scientific collaborations. A community of about 3000 scientific authors from 181 institutions and 41 countries~\cite{AtlasCollab} work towards making the most precise measurements of the Standard Model and potentially finding experimental hints for New Physics with the ATLAS detector.



% This might be good for the thesis introduction and is also repeated below
% Physics beyond the SM is typically referred to as ``New Physics''.
% The quest to find new physics is usually driven by looking for deviations of the SM predictions.
% Therefore, it is important to understand with high precision the physics of the SM itself, in particular the properties of the particles that are predicted to couple to new physics. 
% The Higgs boson is often seen as a portal to new physics, which motivates measuring its properties precisely. 

% From current limitations of SM
% The Higgs boson takes a special role in the SM because it is the only fundamental scalar. Its nature makes it a suitable candidate in many models beyond the SM to predict couplings between the Higgs boson and particles from new physics~\cite{2019BHeinemann}.
% This highly motivates precision measurements of the Higgs boson to be able to detect small deviations from the SM predictions. 


% Simulated $pp$ collision events are therefore generated to compare the data against what is expected given the current knowledge of particle physics.

% From gianotti
% The Higgs boson as a starting point
% Recent experimental results, in particular
% from the LHC, have radically transformed
% the status of particle physics and form
% the basis for future research directions.
% The discovery of the Higgs boson has
% been a turning point, unveiling a particle
% with unprecedented characteristics and
% shedding new light on a phenomenon
% that has surprising similarities with 
% the way certain materials behave
% as superconductors below a critical
% temperature.
% It was fascinating to realize that the same
% phenomenon operates at cosmic scales,
% and made the early Universe undergo
% a phase transition that transformed the
% nature of empty space. Nevertheless,
% believing that the Higgs boson discovery
% has completed our understanding of this
% complex phenomenon is too simplistic.
% On the contrary, much remains to be
% understood about this very special particle,
% including whether it is an elementary
% or composite object, how it leads to the
% peculiar pattern of quark and lepton masses
% observed, what determines the stability of
% the vacuum and what triggered the phase
% transition in the early Universe.
% These questions are still largely
% unexplored experimentally and raise deep
% conceptual concerns theoretically. That is
% why the ESPP update has identified the
% detailed study of the Higgs boson as the
% most pressing priority for the field. Since
% the Higgs boson discovery in 2012 the
% general-purpose LHC experiments, ATLAS
% and CMS, have made extraordinary
% progress in pinning down the features
% of this particle and, by the end of LHC
% operation in 2038 — thanks to the
% high-luminosity upgrades of the collider
% and the detectors — they should be able to
% measure the Higgs boson properties with
% greatly improved precision.
% To gain even deeper insights into the
% Higgs boson and its role in fundamental
% physics, the ESPP recommends an electron–
% positron collider as the next facility, followed
% by a high-energy proton–proton collider in
% the longer term.

In this thesis, the \cref{chap:theory,chap:experiment,chap:objects} review existing literature. \Cref{chap:calibration} first discusses necessary background knowledge on jet calibration before presenting the noise term measurement of the jet energy resolution. The author carried out all aspects of the noise term measurement and improved the measurement uncertainties by introducing several new methodologies and strategies described in the text. This measurement has been successfully performed for the first time for both particle-flow jets (published in \ccite{JETM-2018-05}) and \emph{R-scan} jets (jets with a radius of $R=0.2$ and $R=0.6$, publication currently in ATLAS internal review), as a result of the author's studies and research.

The \cref{chap:statistics,chap:ml} summarize the statistical analysis methodologies that are used in the \HWW analysis which is presented in the following \cref{chap:hww}. The description of the \HWW analysis presents original research to which the author contributed significantly. Most notably, the author trained, validated, and incorporated a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to distinguish the VBF signal from background events in the VBF couplings analysis. This included the development of new strategies to use the DNN output score as the final discriminant in the statistical analysis. These studies also extended to the VBF STXS analysis, for which the same DNN was adopted and for which the author introduced several improvements.
The author developed and studied the fit model used for the VBF couplings and STXS analysis intensively and implemented several improvements to the treatment of systematic uncertainties.
Moreover, the author contributed significantly to the development and improvement of the analysis framework used, resulting in significant enhancements to several aspects of the overall workflow. This proved highly useful to many analyzers inside and outside the \HWW group.
Besides these main contributions, the author frequently contributed to review meetings, performed several other smaller optimization and validation studies, is co-author of the internal supporting documentation, and provided final results for the analyses that are published in \ccite{ATLAS-CONF-2021-014,ATLAS-CONF-2020-045}.
