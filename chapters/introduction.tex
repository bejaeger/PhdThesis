% \Cref{chap:hww} is the main part of this thesis and presents the measurement of VBF and ggF Higgs boson production cross sections in the \HWW\ decay channel. The analysis presented is published in \ccite{HWWPaper}. The author contributed significantly to many aspects of the analysis, with most of the work related to the measurement of the VBF production mode.
% Most notably, the author trained, validated, and incorporated a deep neural network (DNN) to distinguish VBF, \HWW events from other events, which lead to a substantial reduction in measurement uncertainties.
% The DNN was used for both the inclusive cross-section measurement and the measurement within the STXS framework.
% % This included the development of new strategies to use the DNN output as final discriminant in the statistical analysis. 
% % The author also studied different analysis strategies for the cross-section measurements within the STXS framework.
% The author developed and extensively studied the statistical model used for both measurements, and introduced several improvements to the treatment of systematic uncertainties.
% Furthermore, the author contributed significantly to the development and improvement of the analysis framework as well as the statistical framework. As a result, several aspects of the overall analysis workflow have been vastly improved, which has proved extremely useful to many analyzers inside and outside the \HWW analysis group.
% Besides these main contributions, the author frequently contributed to review meetings, performed several smaller optimization and validation studies, is co-author of the internal supporting documentation, and provided final results for the analyses that are published in \ccite{HWWPaper,ATLAS-CONF-2021-014}.

% Learning From Experience: Measurement of HWW decays to two W bosons with a "learned" discriminator

% The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is currently the most comprehensive theoretical basis for the study of the fundamental laws of nature.

% - To produce collision events at the highest energies, circular accelerators are built in order to gradually increase the energy of the particles.

% \Minote{}{Mention previous experiments? Tevatron, ...other?}

% The ATLAS experiment is operated by one of the world's largest scientific collaborations. A community of about 3000 scientific authors from 181 institutions and 41 countries~\cite{AtlasCollab} work towards making the most precise measurements of the Standard Model and potentially finding experimental hints for New Physics with the ATLAS detector.

% All experimental measurements show remarkable consistency with the predictions of the SM. 

%Only with a precise knowledge of Higgs processes and an understanding of what exact role the Higgs boson plays in nature, fundamental physics can come closer to answering some of the open fundamental questions.  

% By now the Higgs is firmly established in the SM. 

% This might be good for the thesis introduction and is also repeated below
% Physics beyond the SM is typically referred to as ``New Physics''.
% The quest to find new physics is usually driven by looking for deviations of the SM predictions.
% Therefore, it is important to understand with high precision the physics of the SM itself, in particular the properties of the particles that are predicted to couple to new physics. 
% The Higgs boson is often seen as a portal to new physics, which motivates measuring its properties precisely. 

% From current limitations of SM
% The Higgs boson takes a special role in the SM because it is the only fundamental scalar. Its nature makes it a suitable candidate in many models beyond the SM to predict couplings between the Higgs boson and particles from new physics~\cite{2019BHeinemann}.
% This highly motivates precision measurements of the Higgs boson to be able to detect small deviations from the SM predictions. 

% Simulated $pp$ collision events are therefore generated to compare the data against what is expected given the current knowledge of particle physics.

% From gianotti
% The Higgs boson as a starting point
% Recent experimental results, in particular
% from the LHC, have radically transformed
% the status of particle physics and form
% the basis for future research directions.
% The discovery of the Higgs boson has
% been a turning point, unveiling a particle
% with unprecedented characteristics and
% shedding new light on a phenomenon
% that has surprising similarities with 
% the way certain materials behave
% as superconductors below a critical
% temperature.
% It was fascinating to realize that the same
% phenomenon operates at cosmic scales,
% and made the early Universe undergo
% a phase transition that transformed the
% nature of empty space. Nevertheless,
% believing that the Higgs boson discovery
% has completed our understanding of this
% complex phenomenon is too simplistic.
% On the contrary, much remains to be
% understood about this very special particle,
% including whether it is an elementary
% or composite object, how it leads to the
% peculiar pattern of quark and lepton masses
% observed, what determines the stability of
% the vacuum and what triggered the phase
% transition in the early Universe.
% These questions are still largely
% unexplored experimentally and raise deep
% conceptual concerns theoretically. That is
% why the ESPP update has identified the
% detailed study of the Higgs boson as the
% most pressing priority for the field. Since
% the Higgs boson discovery in 2012 the
% general-purpose LHC experiments, ATLAS
% and CMS, have made extraordinary
% progress in pinning down the features
% of this particle and, by the end of LHC
% operation in 2038 — thanks to the
% high-luminosity upgrades of the collider
% and the detectors — they should be able to
% measure the Higgs boson properties with
% greatly improved precision.
% To gain even deeper insights into the
% Higgs boson and its role in fundamental
% physics, the ESPP recommends an electron–
% positron collider as the next facility, followed
% by a high-energy proton–proton collider in
% the longer term.

% Precise understanding of Higgs processes may also reveal other deviations from the SM predictions that could, for example, shed light on the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. \todo{FIND citation or leave out!}
