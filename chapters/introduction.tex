\section{Contributions by the Author}
\label{sec:contributions}

In this Thesis, the \cref{chap:theory,chap:experiment,chap:objects} are reviewing existing literature. \Cref{chap:calibration} first discusses necessary background knowledge on jet calibration before presenting the noise term measurement of the jet energy resolution. All aspects of the noise term measurement were carried out by the author including the development of several new methodologies and strategies that improve the measurement uncertainties. This measurement has been successfully performed for the first time for both particle-flow jets and variable-radius jets, as a result of the author's studies and research.
The \cref{chap:statistics,chap:ml} provide an overview of the statistical analysis methodologies that are used in the \HWW analysis presented in the following \cref{chap:hww}. The description of the \HWW analysis presents original research to which the author contributed significantly. 
Most notably, the author trained, validated, and incorporated a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to distinguish VBF signal from background events in the VBF couplings analysis. This included the development of new strategies for the statistical analysis which uses the DNN output score as final discriminant. These studies also extended to the VBF STXS analysis, for which the same DNN was adopted and for which the author introduced several improvements.
The author developed and studied the used fit model for the VBF couplings and STXS analysis intensively and implemented several improvements to the treatment of systematic uncertainties. 
Moreover, the author contributed significantly to the development and improvement of the used analysis framework, resulting in significant enhancements to several aspects of the overall workflow. This proved highly useful to many analyzers also outside the \HWW group. 
Besides these main contributions, the author frequently contributed to review meetings, performed several other smaller optimization and validation studies, is co-author of the internal supporting documentation, and provided final results for the analysis that is published in \ccite{ATLAS-CONF-2021-014}.
\Cref{chap:introduction,chap:summary} provide an introduction and a summary of this work and are of purely supplementary nature.
