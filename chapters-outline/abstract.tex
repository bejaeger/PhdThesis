\addchap*{About This Version}
This version of my thesis shows an outline of the content I intend to include and is meant to be reviewed by the committee.
I included a short paragraph stating my main research contributions below.
The figures that will be the main highlights of this thesis are also included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item My work for the jet/etmiss group culminated in the noise term results shown in \cref{fig:noise-term-results-pflow}, which was input to the JER combination, as shown in \cref{fig:jer-combination-incl-noise-term,fig:jer-combination-results,fig:jer-combination-uncertainties}.
    \item My main research focused on the \HWW analysis. The currently public results are shown in \cref{fig:post-fit-final-discriminatns,fig:avocado-plot,fig:stxs-pois-bar-plot,tab:stxs-xsec-uncertainties} (Note: these results will be updated to the ones included in the upcoming paper).
\end{itemize}
